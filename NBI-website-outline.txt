The no block limit Initiative - 

“By removing the blocksize limit, we are guaranteed that bitcoin can and will become cash for the entire world for years to come”

PSA:  All of the major BCH clients allow you to remove the blocksize limit.

“The blocksize limit is now nothing more than a Trojan Horse. It's existence in the protocol is a threat to scaling as long as it remains. The limit is nothing more than a restriction on the output of miners. We should push to remove the limit in our next hard fork.” - reddit user
